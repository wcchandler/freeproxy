FOSS Alternative to (OCLC's) EZProxy

It looks like OCLC is going to start charging an annual fee beginning in 2014.  I do not like this.  As such, I am looking to build a FOSS solution.

The plan is to use Apache as a base, with various scripts to handle adding databases and other various tidbits.

This post talks briefly how we're going to add DBs to the configuration: http://serverfault.com/questions/341696/open-source-free-alternative-to-ezproxy .

Authentication will probably be handled via PAM.  I'm not sure.  It's been a while since I've looked into user auth with Apache.

It'll be nice to have *everything* GUI driven from an admin interface.  We'll see how that goes, though.  I'll also work on a flowchart for others insight.  Feel free to email me with any questions.  $USERNAME @ gmail.

I've also setup an IRC channel on freenode - #freeproxy .

I'd like to have a working product by beginning/middle of July.  Hopefully that can let people deploy it in August and get it ready for some minor testing for the Fall semester, in perfect time for the fees to trickle in come January 2014.

I'm looking forward to this project!
